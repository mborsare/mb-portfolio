At Moosilauke is a campaign and brand for a weekend long fundraiser at its namesake in New Hampshire. Mount Moosilauke is a 4,802’ peak in the Granite State’s White Mountains (the most rugged range in New England). It belongs to Dartmouth College and was the spot of the nation’s first downhill ski championship in the 1930s.

At Moosilauke’s branding harkens back to that era – when people weren’t tethered to their mobile phones, wifi or social networks. These days people have gotten a little soft. Mount Moosilauke is the remedy.
