The Corvias Group creates communities. They provide development, construction and property management services to educational and military clients. In the spring of 2013 I was the lead designer on a team that redesigned their web site. The site highlights news around Corviasâ€™ communities, provides a snapshot of their properties, and serves as a gateway for housing application.
