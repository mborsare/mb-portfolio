Mark Twain was an American treasure. He wrote some amazing poems, and this is a poster for one of the best. The War Prayer is a diatribe on the horrors of war. The design of the poster runs purposely counter to the prose’s brutality. The ornate typefaces and Victorian aesthetic disguise a savage tale.
