Deluge is an autobiographical tale of a young woman’s confrontation and conquering of aquaphobia (fear of water). This book jacket expresses the anxiety felt by the tale’s main character via bold geometric shapes mimicking a downpour. The color palette was born from the vibrant colors of rain gear.
